Overview
========

Simple scripts with basically no organization or optimization to solve the
Project Euler problems. Mostly in R, some in Python when it seemed like it 
would be better suited to the task and occasionally in C when I feel like I 
want the extra speed/want to practice my C/have a lot of time for debugging. 

The scripts are likely terrible, slow and inefficient. You have been warned. No 
judging. 

All of the scripts are released under GPL.
